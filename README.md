# Customer_Churn_Capstone

Project Overview:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn, allowing businesses to proactively address customer attrition and improve retention rates.

Key Objectives:

Churn Prediction: Accurately predict which customers are likely to churn.
Proactive Interventions: Implement targeted interventions to retain at-risk customers.
Customer Satisfaction: Improve customer satisfaction by addressing underlying issues that lead to churn.
Cost Reduction: Reduce the costs associated with customer acquisition by retaining existing customers.
Data Requirements:

Customer Data: Collect relevant customer data, including demographics, purchase history, website interactions, and customer support interactions.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing features to improve model performance (e.g., customer lifetime value, recency-frequency-monetary (RFM) scores, churn indicators).
Data Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
Data Normalization: Normalize numerical features to a common scale.
Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
Model Selection and Training:

Algorithm Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for customer churn prediction (e.g., classification algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, or gradient boosting).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search. Â  
Model Training: Train the selected model on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation:

Metrics: Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve).
Visualization: Visualize the model's predictions and performance using techniques like confusion matrices and ROC curves.
Deployment and Integration:

Deployment: Deploy the trained model into a production environment.
Integration: Integrate the model with existing systems (e.g., CRM, customer support) to automate churn prediction and intervention.
